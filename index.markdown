Ph.D Student @
[Computational Quantum Materials Physics Lab](https://yw-choi.github.io/)
Department of Physics, Sogang University.

I am a Ph.D. student in computational condensed matter physics,
focusing on excitonic effects and many-body perturbation theory
(GW-BSE) in low-dimensional materials.

### Research Interests
- Excitons and optical properties in 2D materials
- Many-body perturbation theory (GW, BSE)
- First-principles electronic structure calculations

### Current Work
- Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations for layered semiconductors
- Exciton analysis and visualization tools

### Links
- [CV]({{ "/assets/CV_2025.pdf" | relative_url }})
- Google Scholar (coming soon)
